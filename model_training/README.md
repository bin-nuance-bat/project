# Training the model

Everything you need to train and evaluate models is found in this directory.

## Prerequisites

To perform training you will need [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-362/) installed (we used 3.6.2 as this was what was suggested on the tensorflow website). If using windows be sure to add Python to your path variable (you can do this through the python installer) and increase your maximum path length if prompted to do so at the end of installation. Then, you can install the `tesorflowjs` package using pip. For more detailed tensorflow installation instructions see [here](https://www.tensorflow.org/install/).

```bash
$ pip install tensorflowjs
```

## Training Data

Training data should be placed in a directory `training_data` inside of this directory. In here you should have a subdirectory for each category of item you wish the model to recognise. These subdirectories should be named according to the items ID in the honesty.store. You should also include an unknown category. An example of the folder structure is shown below:

```
project
├── firebase
├── functions
├── model_training
|   ├── training_data
|   |   ├── 1eb45850-3bb1-4b66-a816-27d856f03afe
|   |   |   ├── 0UcozuglhkZrFXPaTDLX.jpg
|   |   |   ├── 0YAX6oF8H4lELvAs4Bt5.jpg
|   |   |   ...
|   |   ├── 02bbc0fd-54c4-45bb-9b77-21b79b356aa6
|   |   |   ├── 0yvz4mFTAkuiEIndHmS6.jpg
|   |   |   ├── 1d3IxV0ZVySjaMsBKo4x.jpg
|   |   |   ...
|   |   ├── unknown
|   |   |   ├── 0cLte488TJU9RnzyUMYG.jpg
|   |   |   ├── 0DaTNEiLWhlCFjA9Rhpp.jpg
|   |   |   ...
|   |   ...
|   ...
...
```

If using the `honesty-store-kiosk` firebase project, you can also automatically download all training data by executing `download.sh` in this directory. This requires [`gsutil`](https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/gsutil_install) to be installed and configured, however. Run the intaller package from Google Cloud and when prompted to initialise gsutil you should do so, logging in to your Google Account in the browser when asked. NOTE: that `download.sh` downloads all images (including untrusted). To download only trusted images use the admin panel.

## Training

In order to train a new model based on the data provided in this directory, open up your terminal in this directory and run `train.sh`. Note this will perform ML training and may take some minutes and dramatically increase your CPU and memory usage.

Once training is complete you will see a new model has been generated in the `model` directory. This model is in the TensorFlow SavedModel format which cannot be used as is by the browser. However, the script also converts this model to a web freindly format and saves this in the correct place within the project (`public/model`) along with a JSON file that maps the models outputs to honesty.store IDs.

Therefore, once training is complete, you need only build and deploy the application again to see the new model take effect.

## Evaluation

In order to evaluate a models accuracy, a Python script is included. You should place evaluation data in a directory named `eval_data` using the same directory structure as the training data. Once again, if using the official firebase project, the `download.sh` script will have already done this for you. In order to obtain an accuracy score for the model you have trained simply execute the following command:

```bash
python evaluate.py
```
